![image](docs/images/mongo.gif)
1. Checkout the issue-api repository from Git<https://github.com/ANE-UCD-MULESOFT-TRAINING/issue-api> and branch 1.design-and-import. 
  This would get the base code to start the development for this exercise. 
  Import the project into Anypoint Studio by selecting import project, Anypoint studio project. This would open the Mule Project inanypoint studio. 
 
  Once the project is open, Run the project to check if it loads correctly. This step should download all the dependencies required as well. 
2. Once the build is complete and you validate that the app is loading correctly, lets perform the next step of adding the modules required for this project. Lets start with       
importing Mongo DB connector. 
    To do this click on the exchange button 
    Log into anypoint exchange if prompted for login.
    Select Provided by MuleSoft on the left side bar and search for mongodb.

For this exercise we will use the MongoDB Mule 4 Connector. Now lets select the version 5.4 for this lab exercise.



Click on Add to project and the connector should be added to the project and you should be able to see that in the Mule Palette.

Now that the dependency is added, lets get started with implementing the Post Issue method. For this we will be reading data from 5 collections (col_lrqi_drivers, col_lrqi_vehicles, col_lrqi_customers, col_lrqi_rate_issue &, col_lrqi_incidents).
So lets start first by writing the connection to mongodb to fetch data.
Lets create a new Mule configuration file and name it as policy-api-implementation

Lets start by creating the configuration inside this file, we will first add a sub flow component from Mule palette and add a mongo find one document. Post this step the xml content should look like below
